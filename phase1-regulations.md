# Phase 1 Regulations Document

## Overview

Phase 1 of the Smart Calendar system development focuses on implementing the core functionalities to establish a functional prototype. This phase includes User Registration & Authentication, Event Creation & Management, and a basic Calendar view. The implementation will use JavaScript for the frontend, PHP for the backend, and MySQL database via XAMPP.

## Implementation Plan

### User Registration & Authentication
- **Frontend**: Create HTML forms for signup and login, with JavaScript for client-side validation and AJAX for submission.
- **Backend**: PHP scripts to handle registration (insert user into database) and login (verify credentials, start session).
- **Database**: Users table with fields: id, name, email, password (hashed), user_type.
- **Security**: Use password_hash() in PHP, sessions for authentication.

### Event Creation & Management
- **Frontend**: Form for creating events, list view for managing (edit/delete).
- **Backend**: PHP APIs for CRUD operations on events.
- **Database**: Events table with fields: id, user_id, title, description, start_datetime, end_datetime, location, participants (JSON).
- **Features**: Basic create, edit, delete; no collaboration yet.

### Basic Calendar View
- **Frontend**: JavaScript to render monthly calendar, fetch events via AJAX.
- **Backend**: PHP to query events for the user.
- **Display**: Simple grid with event titles on dates.

## Technologies
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla, no frameworks for simplicity).
- Backend: PHP.
- Database: MySQL (XAMPP).

## Testing
- Unit tests for PHP functions.
- Manual testing for UI interactions.

## Timeline
- Week 1: Setup database and backend auth.
- Week 2: Frontend auth and event CRUD.
- Week 3: Calendar view and integration.

This phase will provide a solid foundation for subsequent phases, ensuring the system is modular and extensible.
